Web Search Engine using Java

simple search engine using HTML to Text Conversion, Edit distance, Merge sort, Brute Force Search, Java-Regex. 

Brute Force Algorithm:
Brute force is a viable approach to real-world, large-scale problems
Runs in time O(mn), most searches of ordinary text take O(m+n), which is very quick.
 Brute force is fast when the alphabet of the text is large e.g. A..Z, a..z, 1..9, etc.
		
Regex:
Defines a search pattern for strings
Can be a simple character, a fixed string or a complex expression containing special characters describing the pattern
Regular expressions can be used to search, edit and manipulate text.

Edit Distance:
For determining similarity between two strings.
Spell Check/Spell Correction.
Gives users word suggestions based on their input.
Calculates the distance between two words and gives a word with least distance as a word suggestion to the user.
	
Merge Sort: MergeSort uses less comparisons than Quicksort. Because a comparison using Pivots can be quite expensive. 
Well suited in Multi-threading situations.
